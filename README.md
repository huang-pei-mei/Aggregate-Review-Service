## My contributions
Designed and built the Aggregate Review Service.
Coordinated and deployed entire team’s modules on proxy server in AWS EC2 instance.
Utilized agile workflow practices on a 4 -person remote team.

## Requirements
An `nvmrc` file is included if using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
Node 6.13.0.

## Development
The database folder includes two helper functions which generates random data and seed data into the database. The first helper function which generates random data and save the generated data into the databaseis located in database/seed.js file. The mongo db setup file which specifies the database schema is located in database/index.js file

The App componet which includes RenderDom is located in client/src/index.js file. Using the following url `http://localhost:2880/api/aggReview/${bookId}` the App component fetches aggregate review information for a given book from the server.

The server with two endpoints are located in server/index.js. The first endpoint is `/api/aggReview/:bookId` This takes a random book id and return an object with the the aggregate review information for a single book as per the schema specified in the database/index.js file.

The second endpont`/api/reviews/:bookIds` will accept an array of book ids and returns an array of objects with the the aggregate review information book ids included in the request parameters as per the schema specified in the database/index.js file.
